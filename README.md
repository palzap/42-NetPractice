# NetPractice

## Overview
NetPractice is a network configuration training tool that helps you learn about TCP/IP addressing by completing 10 exercises. Each exercise involves configuring small-scale networks and applying TCP/IP addressing principles to solve unique challenges.

## TCP and IP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are two of the foundational protocols of the internet. TCP is responsible for breaking down data into packets, ensuring that the packets are transmitted reliably and in order, and handling congestion control. IP is responsible for routing the packets between networks, using IP addresses to identify the source and destination of each packet.

## Subnets
In networking, subnets are logical divisions of an IP network. Subnets allow for the grouping of devices into smaller, more manageable segments, which can help with security and performance. Each device on a network has an IP address, and the subnet is defined by a subnet mask.

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to define the range of IP addresses in a subnet. It works by indicating which bits in the IP address represent the network portion of the address and which bits represent the host portion. For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation) means that the first three octets of the IP address represent the network portion and the last octet represents the host portion.

## The project
In the NetPractice project, we will apply these concepts to set up and manage networks for different purposes. For example, we might create subnets to separate different departments or groups of devices, or we might use subnet masks to control access to certain parts of the network. Understanding TCP, IP, subnets, and subnet masks will be essential for successfully configuring and managing these networks.
